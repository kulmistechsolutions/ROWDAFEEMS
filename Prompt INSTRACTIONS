Act as a senior full-stack engineer.
I want you to design and generate a complete school fee management system called "Rowdatul Iimaan Fee Management System" using the following tech stack:

Frontend: ReactJS + Vite + TailwindCSS

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: Neon DB (PostgreSQL)

1. Main Purpose of the System

The system is used to manage and track monthly fee payments for parents who pay school fees for their children.
Each parent has:

Full Name

Phone Number

Number of children studying in the school

Total monthly fee amount to be paid (for all children together)

The system must:

Store parent information

Manage monthly fee cycles

Collect payments for specific months

Handle partial payments, outstanding balances, and advance (prepaid) payments

Show a clear fee history and generate receipts

Provide dashboards and reports with charts, filters, and export options.

2. Authentication & User Management

Create a Login page for staff:

Fields: Username / Email, Password

Simple authentication with JWT or session

User roles (at least): Admin, Cashier

Admin can manage users (add, edit, disable users)

Each transaction should store which user collected the payment.

The login page must:

Look modern and clean

Show the school logo (Rowdatul Iimaan) at the top

Be fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)

3. Parent / Payer Management

Create a Parents module with:

Ability to add a parent manually

Ability to import parents from Excel/CSV in bulk

Data fields:

id

parent_name

phone_number

number_of_children

monthly_fee_amount (total monthly fee for all children)

created_at

updated_at

On the Parents page:

Show a table with search and filters

Columns: Parent Name, Phone, Children Count, Monthly Fee, Current Outstanding, Current Month Status (Paid / Unpaid / Partial / Advanced)

Allow Edit and View Fee History per parent.

4. Monthly Fee Setup (Month Setup Module)

There must be a "Month Setup" feature to start a new month’s billing.

On the Month Setup page, the user should:

Choose the year and month (e.g., March 2026) using a calendar-like selector or month dropdown.

Click a button like "Start New Month".

When a new month is created:

For every parent:

The system should bring forward any unpaid amounts from previous months.

If the parent had partial payment last month, the remaining balance should be marked as carried forward.

If the parent did not pay anything last month, the full last month amount becomes outstanding and is carried forward.

If the parent previously paid in advance (advance payment for future months), the system must not charge them again for the months they already prepaid. The prepaid months should reduce their payable amount until those months are exhausted.

Business rules:

A parent cannot be charged double for a month they already fully paid.

A parent who has advance payment should not receive new due amounts until all their advance months are consumed.

For every month, you must keep track of:

monthly_fee

carried_forward_amount (from old debts / previous months)

total_due_this_month

amount_paid_this_month

outstanding_after_payment

5. Collect Monthly Fee (Payment Collection)

Create a "Collect Monthly Fee" page:

At the top, allow the user to select:

The active month (e.g., "November 2025")

Below, show a search box or quick filter where:

When a phone number is typed, the system auto-fills/suggests the parent (search by phone or name).

Once a parent is selected, show:

Parent Name

Phone Number

Number of Children

Monthly Fee

Carried Forward Amount (if any)

Total Due for the selected month

History summary (previous outstanding if needed)

On the payment form:

The user can choose:

Pay this current month

Pay for past months that are still unpaid

Pay advance months (pre-pay future months)

When the user clicks something like "Advance Payment", allow them to:

Select how many months to pay in advance (e.g., 2 months, 3 months)

The system calculates the total amount for selected months and marks those months as paid in advance.

Important constraints:

A parent cannot pay the same month twice.
If the month is already fully paid, show an error like:
"Fee for this month is already fully paid. Only outstanding or advance payments are allowed."

If the parent already paid advance months, the system must not create extra due for those months.

If a parent makes a partial payment, it should be clearly recorded as Partial and the remaining balance becomes Outstanding.

After saving a payment:

Create a transaction record in the database.

Update the status of the month for that parent (Paid / Partial / Unpaid).

Generate a receipt object that can be viewed later.

6. Payment Status & Filters

On the main fee collection/overview pages, add filters:

Paid

Unpaid

Outstanding

Partial

Also show:

Total Collected This Month

Total Outstanding This Month

Total Partial This Month

Total Advance (existing prepaid amounts and remaining value)

These summary numbers should be visible on the dashboard and be recalculated based on the active month.

7. Fee History & Receipts

For each parent, create a "Fee History" section/page:

Show a table of all transactions:

Date

Month/Year the payment belongs to

Amount paid

Payment type (Normal / Partial / Advance / Carry Forward Payment)

Collected by (User)

Status after payment (Paid / Partial / Outstanding)

For each transaction row, there must be a "View Receipt" button.

The Receipt View must show:

School name & logo (Rowdatul Iimaan)

Parent name, phone number

Month (or months) the payment covers

Amount paid, breakdown (monthly fee, carried forward, advance)

Remaining balance (if any)

Date and time of payment

The user (staff) who collected the payment

The exact SMS text that was or will be sent to the parent.

The receipt must be:

Viewable on screen

Downloadable as PDF

Printable

Also, allow downloading full history as Excel for a specific parent.

8. SMS Text Handling (No actual SMS integration required)

When a payment is collected:

Generate an SMS-style message text such as:
"Dear [ParentName], you have paid [Amount] for [Month/Months] at Rowdatul Iimaan School. Remaining balance: [Balance]. Thank you."

Save this message text together with the transaction record.

On the parent profile’s month view, allow staff to copy the SMS text and paste it manually into a phone.

Do not implement real SMS gateway, just generate and store the message.

9. Exports (Excel & PDF)

Implement export features:

On the month overview, allow:

Export all fee records for that month as Excel (with columns: Parent Name, Phone, Monthly Fee, Paid Amount, Outstanding, Status).

On reports, allow:

Export summary reports to Excel.

On fee history and receipts:

Download as PDF.

10. Reports & Dashboard

Create a modern dashboard with charts and cards showing:

Select Month (and Year) at the top.

KPIs:

Total Collected (for selected month)

Total Outstanding (debts not yet paid)

Total Partial (number of parents with partial payments)

Total Advance (total value of prepaid months)

Charts:

Bar chart: Collection per month across the year

Pie or donut chart: distribution of Paid vs Unpaid vs Partial for the selected month

Line chart: Monthly collection trend over the year

Dashboard UI Requirements:

Use beautiful cards, icons, and clean typography

Use TailwindCSS for styling

Fully responsive design

Left sidebar with navigation:

Dashboard

Parents

Collect Fee

Month Setup

Reports

Users Management

Settings

11. Database Design (Neon PostgreSQL)

Propose and implement a clean relational schema. At minimum include tables:

users

parents

billing_months

parent_month_fee (parent’s fee status per month)

payments

payment_items (if needed to split payments into normal / carried forward / advance)

Ensure the schema supports:

Multiple months

Carry forward balances

Advance payments

Partial payments

Safe constraints to prevent double-charging the same month.

12. Backend API

Implement RESTful endpoints such as (examples, you may refine):

POST /auth/login

GET /me

GET /parents

POST /parents

PUT /parents/:id

POST /parents/import

POST /month-setup (create new billing month and initialize parent-month records)

GET /months

GET /fees?month=YYYY-MM

POST /payments (create a new payment, handle all business rules)

GET /parents/:id/history

GET /payments/:id/receipt

GET /reports/summary?month=YYYY-MM

GET /reports/export-excel?month=YYYY-MM

Make sure API responses are clean JSON, and include all data needed for the React frontend.

13. Frontend Structure (React + Vite + Tailwind)

Use a modern frontend structure:

React Router for pages

Layout with sidebar + top bar

Pages:

Login

Dashboard

Parents List + Add/Edit Parent

Month Setup

Collect Fee

Fee Status (with filters)

Reports

Users Management

Profile / Settings

Use:

Reusable components (Cards, Tables, Filters, Modals, Buttons, Inputs)

Form validation and friendly error messages

Loading and empty states

14. UI/UX Requirements

Make the design modern, clean, and professional.

Use TailwindCSS utility classes properly.

Use nice icons (e.g., from Heroicons or similar).

All pages must be fully responsive for mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop.

Keep the color theme suitable for a school management app.

15. What I Want From You

Design the database schema.

Design the REST API.

Generate sample code structure for:

Backend (Node.js + Express + Neon/PostgreSQL)

Frontend (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)

Show example implementations for:

Month setup logic

Payment collection logic (including partial, outstanding, and advance payment rules)

Dashboard summary & charts

Fee history and receipt generation (including a simple PDF generation example if possible)

Make sure the logic strictly follows all business rules described above.

If something is unclear, make reasonable assumptions and continue, but keep the system simple, clean, and easy to extend.
